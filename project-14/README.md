## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript


### What I learned
I learned how to implement visual responsive outcomes to user inputs using JavaScript, CSS ad HTML.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on mobile-first web design. I think that's going to be essential part of my future web design career.

These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
Also develop my understanding and abilities with JavaScript on the front-end before immerse myself fully into the back-end.
