# 30 Days, 30 Challenges

This repository is where I will track my new challenge. Practice, dedication, and consistency lead to improvement, not just in programming but also in all aspects of life.

## Why Did I Decide to Embark on This Journey?

- Short answer:
  To land a job.

- Long answer:
  To enhance my programming skills and acquire one of the most important soft skills any developer should have: consistency!

## Which Technologies Will I Use?

Most of these challenges will focus on front-end development. As a result, the most common languages and frameworks you'll find in this repository are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, this may change in the future, with the addition of the React JS library and the static site framework Astro.
